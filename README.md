# portfolio-website
This project is a responsive, dark-themed personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information in a modern and professional way. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website features dynamic page loading, smooth scrolling, and subtle animations to enhance the user experience. The design is clean and minimalist, with a focus on usability and aesthetics.

The website includes several key sections: a Home Page that welcomes visitors and introduces the portfolio, an **About Me** section with a brief biography and profile image, a **Skills** section highlighting my technical expertise, and a Hobbies section that showcases my personal interests. In the **Portfolio** section, users can explore the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, complete with descriptions and links to live demos or repositories. Finally, the **Contact** section provides my contact details and social media links, allowing users to easily get in touch with me.

A key feature of the website is the Dark Mode Toggle, which allows users to switch between dark and light themes for a personalized browsing experience. The Dynamic Page Loading feature ensures smooth navigation between sections without requiring full-page reloads, creating a seamless user experience. Additionally, the website is fully Responsive, making it accessible and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.

The project leverages HTML for structuring the content, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for interactive features such as animations and page transitions. Social media icons are provided via Font Awesome, and modern typography is sourced from Google Fonts.

To use the website, simply clone the repository, navigate to the project folder, and open the `index.html` file in your browser. This portfolio serves as a foundation that can be expanded with more projects and additional features in the future, such as an integrated contact form to allow users to send direct messages.
